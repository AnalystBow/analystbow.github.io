### Data Modeling with Postgres

#### Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. My role was to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. 

#### Project Overview
In this project, I applied my data modeling with Postgres skills to build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, I defined fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and wrote an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

### Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

#### Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions. My role was to create a database for this analysis.

#### Project Overview
To complete the project, I modeled the data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries.

### ETL Pipeline and Data Warehouse

#### Project Description
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

My role was to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms the data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.
