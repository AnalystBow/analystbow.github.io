### Data Engineering Projects

[Data Modeling with Postgres](/sample_page)

#### Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. My role was to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. 

#### Project Description
In this project, I applied my data modeling with Postgres skills to build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, I defined fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and wrote an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
