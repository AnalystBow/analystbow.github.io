Best way to get my attention: Tell me you make better jollof rice than me. I'm not a great cook or anything (hence Data Engineer and not a Chef) - I just love to cook and show off.

So now that food is off the table, here's me. A data professional with knowledge and expertise in maximizing scalability, I build pipelines, analyze large datasets to streamline decision making process and cultivate efficiencies. I'm always looking for opportunities to get into a state of "flow" - seeking fun, engaging problems to work on. Once i'm there, it's magic. Now all I need is someone to pay me to do it.

With experience is Data Analytics and Business Analytics, I have helped teams & clients:
- Shape big visions into actual products and services
- Translate technical jargon into simple terms
- Translate data opportunities into business outcome

With a newfound love for Data Engineering (I continue to learn everyday), moving forward, I'd love to use my skills and experiences to contribute to building and installing data systems that are not just well designed but also functional, scalable, and reliable.

Work aside, I'm always looking forward to travelling - whether it's a new country or just a train ride to a place I haven't been before. I also love working on side projects that educate people about reducing the amount of food waste that we produce in our kitchen. 

I'd love to hear from you!
